# AppName(Tentative)

## Set up CI to host the built version of your team GH repository. 
 - Include a link to your deployed app in README.md so that I can take a look
 - [ ] https://shareclassnotes.netlify.app

## Include a diagram (in text or drawn or however you please) of your tech stack:
 - What services you will use to host (front end, back end, database)
 - What technologies you will use on the front end and back end
 - What APIs you will call out to

## What does your application do?

- Writing notes during lectures is a real challenge! Make studying easier by uploading your notes and by having access to other student's notes in your class! Note Sharing App connects you to students in your class and from other Univesities.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

- Allows users to view/upload different types of documents from .pdf, .docx, .jpeg, or image from camera.
- Search keywords from notes, even handwritted notes!

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
- User has the option to anonymously upload notes.
- Unregistered users cannot see/upload documents.
- Cannot inject malicious code into db.
